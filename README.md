# Tetris-Basic-Javascript

This is a basic implementation of the classic game Tetris using JavaScript. The game utilizes several built-in JavaScript methods and functions to create the game logic and interactivity.

## JavaScript Methods Used

The following built-in JavaScript methods are used in this implementation:

* `addEventListener()`: Used to attach event listeners for user input.
* `querySelector()`: Used to select a single element from the DOM.
* `querySelectorAll()`: Used to select multiple elements from the DOM.
* `keyCode()`: Used to get the key code of a pressed key.
* `Math.floor()`: Used to round a number down to the nearest integer.
* `Math.random()`: Used to generate random numbers.
* `length`: Property of an array or string that returns the number of elements or characters it contains.
* `forEach()`: Used to iterate over elements of an array.
* `splice()`: Used to add or remove elements from an array.
* `clearInterval()`: Used to stop the execution of a function that was previously scheduled using `setInterval()`.
* `setInterval()`: Used to repeatedly execute a function at specified intervals.
* `some()`: Used to check if at least one element in an array satisfies a condition.
* `innerHTML()`: Property of an element that represents the HTML content inside that element.
* `every()`: Used to check if all elements in an array satisfy a condition.
* `add()`: Used to add a CSS class to an element.
* `remove()`: Used to remove a CSS class from an element.
* `contains()`: Used to check if an element contains a specific CSS class.

These methods are essential for handling user input, manipulating the game elements, updating the game state, and rendering the game on the screen.
